# touch experiment
This is an experiment into the html5 touch api, and a canvas object. It turns out they use different coordinate systems, don't ask me why though. Luckily, [http://www.ckollars.org/canvas-two-coordinate-scales.html](this link) featured exactly the conversion facor I needed. 
I want to learn more math so that I can recognize figures like this myself.
